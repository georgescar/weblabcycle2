        <div class="about"><p><h3>About</h3>
            The Idukki district forms a high altitude plateau with rugged mountainous terrain, 
			several river valleys and deep gorges.[30] The entire northern part of the district forms 
			a sub plateau higher than the rest of the district, this region includes the tallest peaks 
			like Anamudi and includes the areas around Munnar, Pallivasal, Kanthalloor, Vattavada and Mankulam.
			The Pambar river valley (Marayoor, Keezhanthoor) forms an eastern sloping rain shadow region of the 
			Western Ghats. The eastern frontier of the district (Kumily, Kattapana, Nedumkandam, Rajakumari and Ramakkalmedu) 
			constitutes the Cardamon hills. The western part of the district is covered by forests and hills bordering 
			the eastern regions of Ernakulam and Kottayam district like Neriyamangalam, Vannapuram, Thommankuthu, Moolamattom,
			Vagamon and Kuttikanam. Places like Thodupuzha, Koothattukulam, Udumbanoor and Muttom are situated in the semi 
			elevated Thodupuzha river plains with scattered hills. The Periyar river basin in the district which includes
			Vandiperiyar, Ayyapankoil, Rajakkad, Idukki, Cheruthoni and Adimaly is an elevated plateau crisscrossed by river
			valleys and lies between the high peaks of the western and eastern parts of the district. The southern region is
			entirely covered with the forests of the Periyar National Park.
